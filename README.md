## Introduction

[DeployPHP](https://deployer.org) is a deployment tool with built-in support for popular PHP frameworks, making it the best choice for those who primarily work with PHP. Inspired by DeployPHP, I decided to create a similar tool in Python â€” a more widely used language that is also better suited for DevOps. I named it **HapiDeploy**, a remote execution tool. Currently, I plan to support deploying Laravel and Express (with PM2).

> HapiDeploy is still in development. I have just tried a few projects. I may change some public methods. Version v0.1.0 will be released at the end of May 2025 as the first usable version.
