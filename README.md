## Introduction

DeployPHP is a deployment tool with built-in support for popular PHP frameworks, making it the best choice for those who primarily work with PHP. Inspired by DeployPHP, I decided to create a similar tool in Pythonâ€”a more widely used language that is also better suited for DevOps. I named it "HapiDeploy", a remote execution tool. "HapiDeploy" can be used as an SSH client, and I also plan to add support for several frameworks I frequently work with.

> HapiDeploy is still in WIP, some public methods might changed.
